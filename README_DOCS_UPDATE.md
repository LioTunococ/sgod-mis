# Documentation Update Summary

This file summarizes the documentation updates performed as part of Task 9.

Files added:
- `docs/USER_GUIDE.md` - User guide for dashboard, admin creation of school years, forms and submissions.
- `docs/KPI_CALCULATIONS.md` - Overview of KPI calculation functions and usage.
- `docs/TASK_3_FORM_MANAGEMENT_COMPLETE.md` - (Previously added) Task 3 detailed completion document.
- `docs/TASK_5_SMOOTH_TRANSITIONS_COMPLETE.md` - (Previously added) Task 5 completion document.
- `docs/TASK_10_NEW_SCHOOL_YEAR_SYSTEM_COMPLETE.md` - (Previously added) Task 10 completion document.

Next steps:
- Integrate these docs into an internal knowledge base or wiki.
- Optionally add TOC entries to `README.md` linking to `docs/` files.

If you want, I can append a short "Documentation" section to the project's `README.md` linking these new docs — tell me and I'll update `README.md` accordingly.
