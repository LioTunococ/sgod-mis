# Phase B Role Entry Enhancements

## School Head
- Surface a "Your Draft Submissions" card listing in-progress SMME reports with last-updated timestamps.
- Expose quick links to seed demo submissions to speed up training walkthroughs.

## Section Admin
- Add top-of-queue stats (submitted today, returned awaiting school, noted this quarter) above the review table.
- Include a shortcut panel for CSV/XLSX exports so the reviewer does not have to open the detail page first.

## PSDS / SGOD
- On the district dashboard, add a summary card per district showing completion rate, DNME %, and latest burn rate pulled from SMME.
- Provide a link to the seeded demo submission so the monitoring team can reference the same dataset during the presentation.

These can be implemented iteratively once Phase A lands; the redirects are already in place via `post_login_redirect`.
